| Backward Chaining |
|---------|
|<p align="justify">Backward chaining is a reasoning method in artificial intelligence that works by starting from the end goal or desired conclusion, then going backwards through the available rules or data to determine whether the conclusion is correct. This method is very popular in expert systems, such as medical diagnosis or troubleshooting, because this approach emphasizes proving a particular hypothesis or conjecture.</p>  |
